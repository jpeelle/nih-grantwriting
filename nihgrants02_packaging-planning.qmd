## Questions? {background-image="images/jp01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat"}


##

You have a lot of reaearch ideas. You want to write a grant. What ideas go in which grant?


## Guiding principles

 - It is unlikely you will get every grant you submit
 - You can't have scientific overlap in funded work
 - It can be weird for reviewers to review multiple grants from the same PI at study section


## It is unlikely you will get every grant you submit

 - If the IC payline is 10th percentile, you need to submit 10 grants to get funded (on average)
    - 1/year = 10 years to get funded
    - 3/year (1 per cycle) = 3 years to get funded
    - 6/year (2 per cycle) = 1.5 years to get funded
 - Conclusion: submit a lot of grants
 - Implications: you have to be efficient

## Homework

 - ?
 - Think of at least one general topic, and two distinct grants

## Homework notes

 - These starting steps might seem straightforward but they can be tricky
 - For example, the topic may push you towards one institute or potential study section; different approaches may require different budgets, etc.
 - Remember, you can change your mind!


## Next time {background-image="images/huskies01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat" background-opacity=0.5}

 - Now that you have a potential topic, how to get started?
    - Budget
    - Specific aims
