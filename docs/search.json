    "text": "Understanding speech is an active process. Our ability to make sense of a noisy world requires both an intact auditory system, and the flexible engagement of executive resources. Although in many cases a cochlear implant (CI) can restore hearing to a deaf individual, many CI users experience suboptimal outcomes. Perhaps our best chance of optimizing CI outcomes is by investigating the major sources of variance predictive of long-term success. This project will determine how individual differences in functional brain reorganization and cognitive abilities support successful speech understanding in CI users.\nListeners with CIs are a critical group in which to investigate cognitive processing during speech understanding. Individual differences in performance post-implantation remain challenging to explain: quantitative indices of cognitive load, as we propose here, have the potential to provide additional explanatory power. From a basic science standpoint, listeners with CIs provide an unprecedented opportunity to study neuroplasticity in the human auditory system. Both of these perspectives stand to benefit heavily from functional brain imaging. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of data on localized brain activity in listeners with CIs, as CI hardware is generally not compatible with MRI and causes problematic artifact in EEG and MEG. Here we propose to use state-of-the-art optical imaging methods to circumvent these limitations. We will use recently developed high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) performed with custom-built equipment. HD-DOT will allow us to answer fundamental questions about the neurobiology of speech comprehension in listeners with CIs previously impossible to address. We will pursue three aims:"

Substantial differences exist in how well CI recipients are able to understand auditory-only speech. We will measure the brain networks engaged in understanding auditory-only speech in a cohort of adult CI recipients to characterize the individual variability in brain networks supporting successful understanding. We hypothesize that, as a group, listeners with CIs will recruit regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) more than listeners with normal hearing, and that functional connectivity between DLPFC and regions superior temporal cortex will be most related to individual differences in speech recognition accuracy. These methods will generate a compelling amount of data per subject and built-in metrics of within-subject reproducibility to ensure accurate and unbiased estimates of single-subject brain activity."

Although auditory-only speech plays a role in everyday experience (e.g., phone calls), a great deal of communication takes place in the context of face-to-face conversation. We will contrast patterns of brain activation for auditory-only vs. audiovisual speech in the context of a movie, emphasizing ecological validity by approximating real-world communicative scenarios (i.e., connected speech and rich visual scenes). We predict that 1) multimodal cues provided by audiovisual speech will reduce cognitive demands resulting in downregulation of DLPFC, and 2) individual differences in functional connectivity between visual, auditory, and prefrontal cortex will account for discrepancies in auditory only vs. audiovisual speech performance."

We hypothesize that improved speech intelligibility will be associated with increased task-based functional connectivity between DLPFC and temporal lobe regions important for speech processing. We also use the data in exploratory analyses in which we will link pre-surgical imaging to post-surgical outcomes to improve the accuracy of outcome success. In particular, whether resting state network organization pre-surgery reflects a predisposition to post-surgical reorganization."

My background in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and hearing research make me well-qualified to lead such an effort. For the last 20+ years my research has focused on understanding age-related changes in speech understanding, and how these reflect complex interactions of auditory and cognitive factors. My lab has used extensive behavioral testing to look at relationships between individual differences in how auditory and cognitive ability affect understanding speech in challenging listening situations, such as in background noise, age-related hearing loss, or with a cochlear implant. We have routinely supplemented these behavioral tools with physiological measures including pupillometry and functional neuroimaging. In recent years we have also been actively expanding our research to link objective and subjective measures of listening success in a range of participant populations.\nI am extremely excited by the work proposed here, which is a natural extension of my longstanding research program. Dr. Meier and I have been meeting regularly since my arrival at Northeastern and this grant application organically came from our shared interests and complementary expertise.

My background in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and hearing research make me well-qualified to lead such an effort. For the last 20+ years my research has focused on understanding age-related changes in speech understanding, and how these reflect complex interactions of auditory and cognitive factors. My lab has used extensive behavioral testing to look at relationships between individual differences in how auditory and cognitive ability affect understanding speech in challenging listening situations, such as in background noise, age-related hearing loss, or with a cochlear implant. We have routinely supplemented these behavioral tools with physiological measures including pupillometry and functional neuroimaging. In recent years we have also been actively expanding our research to link objective and subjective measures of listening success in a range of participant populations."

However, the signal provided by a cochlear implant does not have the clarity of what would be provided by healthy biological hearing, and the degree to which listeners with cochlear implants can understand spoken language varies considerably from patient to patient. Here we use functional brain imaging to measure the involvement of different brain networks during speech understanding in patients with cochlear implants to better understand individual differences in speech perception."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nListeners with hearing impairment can often understand spoken language, but with increased effort, taking cognitive resources away from other processes such as attention and memory. An important challenge is therefore to understand how the brain copes with a degraded speech signal and the cognitive processes that are most critical to successful comprehension. Adult listeners with cochlear implants are a unique group in which to investigate effortful listening: They have typically adapted to auditory deprivation for a period of years of profound hearing loss, followed by some degree of hearing restoration following implantation. Following increased auditory input due to cochlear implantation, the degree to which individual listeners are able to successfully recognize speech, especially in the presence of background noise, is extremely variable. Previous attempts to explain this variability in the context of underlying patterns of brain activity have been unsuccessful, in large part because the technical challenges associated with neuroimaging in the presence of an implanted medical device have prevented adequate localization of neural responses to speech. The goal of our research is to understand the cognitive systems that support speech recognition in listeners with cochlear implants and to use knowledge about these systems to improve behavioral outcomes. We do so using converging evidence from behavioral measures and functional brain imaging. We make use of high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a form of optical brain imaging that produces anatomically-localized indices of regional cortical activity. We will map the brain networks supporting speech comprehension in listeners with cochlear implants, which we expect to differ from those engaged by listeners with good hearing. We will then evaluate the degree to which neural markers of effortful listening can predict individual differences in speech recognition success in the presence of background noise. Together the findings will help ground our understanding of cochlear implant-aided speech recognition in a neuroanatomically-constrained framework and develop more accurate outcome measures."

BFDA is a form of sequential sampling that involves testing until sufficient evidence is collected for, or against, a hypothesis. Note that optional stopping does not bias interpretation of statistics (Rouder, 2014). For every experiment, we will run at least 80 participants per group, and continue until the main outcome reaches a Bayes Factor of ≥ 10 or ≤ 0.1 (moderate evidence for or against the hypothesis). For planning purposes, we use a traditional multiple regression approach after Maxwell (2000). We assume a correlation of 0.3 between three primary predictor variables (age, hearing level, reward sensitivity), and a correlation of 0.3 between reward sensitivity and speech perception. Entering these into eq. 18 of Maxwell (2000) results in a minimum sample size of 218. We plan for 240 from each age group to account for anticipated 10% attrition. This results in 480 participants for each behavioral experiment (1440 participants)."

For this, we used a prior fMRI study of reward (Wimmer et al., 2012) available on NeuroVault, and the power calculation technique by Durnez et al. (2016), which indicates 36 participants for a power of 0.9. We will run 36 young adults for each fMRI study, planning to recruit 40 to allow for data loss. For the older adults, we are interested in individual differences. Yarkoni and Braver (2010) argue that fMRI studies of individual differences are typically underpowered, and to achieve power of 0.8 for even a large correlation effect requires a minimum of 55 subjects. We will run 72 older adults in all fMRI studies, giving us power of > 0.9 to detect effects reported by Peelle et al. (2011) in a correlation study of hearing and fMRI activity based on ROI-calculated effect sizes (Pearson r = -0.65 in auditory cortex).
