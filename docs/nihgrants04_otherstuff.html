<p>Understanding hearing health in patients who have suffered a stroke requires a broad interdisciplinary approach. My background in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and hearing research make me well-qualified to lead such an effort. For the last 20+ years my research has focused on understanding age-related changes in speech understanding, and how these reflect complex interactions of auditory and cognitive factors. My lab has used extensive behavioral testing to look at relationships between individual differences in how auditory and cognitive ability affect understanding speech in challenging listening situations, such as in background noise, age-related hearing loss, or with a cochlear implant. We have routinely supplemented these behavioral tools with physiological measures including pupillometry and functional neuroimaging. In recent years we have also been actively expanding our research to link objective and subjective measures of listening success in a range of participant populations.</p>

Dr.&nbsp;Meier and I have been meeting regularly since my arrival at Northeastern and this grant application organically came from our shared interests and complementary expertise. Dr.&nbsp;Lin has provided extraordinarily valuable input and has shown unwavering support for our recruitment and data collection plan, particularly critical due to our focus on patients in the acute phase of stroke recovery.</p>

<p>The research environment at Washington University in St.&nbsp;Louis is well established and highly regarded. In 2019, the National Institutes of Health awarded over $523 million for research at Washington University. The Clinical and Translational Research Core within the Department of Otolaryngology provides regulatory and biostatistical support. There is a strong neuroimaging community at Washington University that spans the departments of Radiology, Psychological and Brain Sciences, and Neurology, providing additional technical and theoretical support for the work proposed here. There are twenty adult and pediatric otolaryngologists, including several cochlear implant surgeons, who evaluate patients with ear disorders and refer potential cochlear implant patients for audiological evaluation.</p>

<p>A cochlear implant can provide auditory sensation to someone who would otherwise be deaf due to a dysfunctional inner ear. However, the signal provided by a cochlear implant does not have the clarity of what would be provided by healthy biological hearing, and the degree to which listeners with cochlear implants can understand spoken language varies considerably from patient to patient. Here we use functional brain imaging to measure the involvement of different brain networks during speech understanding in patients with cochlear implants to better understand individual differences in speech perception.</p>

<div style="font-size:.8em">
<p>Listeners with hearing impairment can often understand spoken language, but with increased effort, taking cognitive resources away from other processes such as attention and memory. An important challenge is therefore to understand how the brain copes with a degraded speech signal and the cognitive processes that are most critical to successful comprehension. Adult listeners with cochlear implants are a unique group in which to investigate effortful listening: They have typically adapted to auditory deprivation for a period of years of profound hearing loss, followed by some degree of hearing restoration following implantation. Following increased auditory input due to cochlear implantation, the degree to which individual listeners are able to successfully recognize speech, especially in the presence of background noise, is extremely variable. Previous attempts to explain this variability in the context of underlying patterns of brain activity have been unsuccessful, in large part because the technical challenges associated with neuroimaging in the presence of an implanted medical device have prevented adequate localization of neural responses to speech. The goal of our research is to understand the cognitive systems that support speech recognition in listeners with cochlear implants and to use knowledge about these systems to improve behavioral outcomes. We do so using converging evidence from behavioral measures and functional brain imaging. We make use of high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a form of optical brain imaging that produces anatomically-localized indices of regional cortical activity. We will map the brain networks supporting speech comprehension in listeners with cochlear implants, which we expect to differ from those engaged by listeners with good hearing. We will then evaluate the degree to which neural markers of effortful listening can predict individual differences in speech recognition success in the presence of background noise. Together the findings will help ground our understanding of cochlear implant-aided speech recognition in a neuroanatomically-constrained framework and develop more accurate outcome measures.</p>
