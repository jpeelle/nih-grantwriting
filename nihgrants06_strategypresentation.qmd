## Research Strategy

 - After your aims, the most important part of your grant
 - Improves through iteration, feedback, and experience
 - Important to focus both on *content* (scientific ideas) and *presentation* (how you communicate these ideas, particularly aesthetic and organizational choices)


# Part 2: Presentation

## Guiding principles

Remember your goal (communication) and your audience (tired grant reviewers who aren't as expert in your niche as you think they are)


## Formatting basics

 - Make sure to follow all NIH requirements
 - 11 pt Arial, left justified is a good place to start
 - Being dense seems like it would be good for communicating a lot of information, but it can hinder understanding. Avoid a wall of text!


## Example 1

::: {style="font-size:.8em"}
_Sed consectetur lacus quis ante efficitur sollicitudin._ Pellentesque consectetur scelerisque augue vitae sagittis. Mauris in ex sit amet enim rutrum placerat. Donec tristique tellus metus, in *laoreet libero eleifend et*. Donec mollis sapien neque, id sagittis ipsum fringilla sit amet. _Vivamus justo augue, feugiat in enim vitae, viverra imperdiet turpis._ Integer dictum purus sed fermentum volutpat. Integer imperdiet placerat mi sit amet mollis. Etiam a **rhoncus** dui. Pellentesque tincidunt ac arcu in posuere. Nulla sed laoreet nulla, sed molestie neque. Nunc volutpat fringilla urna, tristique malesuada magna tempor eu.
:::


## Example 2

::: {style="font-size:.8em"}
**Heading**

Pellentesque consectetur scelerisque augue vitae sagittis. Mauris in ex sit amet enim rutrum placerat. Donec tristique tellus metus, in laoreet libero eleifend et. **Donec mollis sapien neque, id sagittis ipsum fringilla sit amet.**

_Subheading_

Integer dictum purus sed fermentum volutpat. Integer imperdiet placerat mi sit amet mollis. Etiam a rhoncus dui. Pellentesque tincidunt ac arcu in posuere. Nulla sed laoreet nulla, sed molestie neque. Nunc volutpat fringilla urna, tristique malesuada magna tempor eu.
::: 


## Organization

 - Be thoughtful about your organization and headings
 - Clearly differentiate levels of information
 - Use styles (i.e. the "styles pane" in Word) for consistency and to facilitate changing styles.


## Styles

![](images/styles.png){fig-align="center"}



## Abbreviations

Many authors try to save space (SS) by using acronyms and abbreviations (UAA) in order to have room to better explain things (BET), which in principle is a good idea (IPGI) and may result in a better score (RBS).

## Abbreviations

However, you may find as a reader that even IPGIs like UAA are confusing and in the end do not RBS because they do not BET.

## Abbreviations

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is distinct from healthy aging (HA) because of the presence of neurofibrilliary plaques and tangles (NPTs). One compelling theory is that NPTs are caused in part by buildup of amyloid beta proteins. Recent theories propose that early stage buildup of amlyloid beta is associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), associated particularly with damage to the hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex (EC). Here we use fMRI and PET to study the structure and function of HC and EC as they relate to HA, MCI, and prodromal AD.

## Abbreviations

 - You are allowed 1-2 (yes really) acroynyms/abbreviations in your application. Don't squander them.
 - It won't kill you to write something out. Yes, it "uses" more characters, but remember that your goal is *communication* and making the reviewer's job easy. If you don't do this, who cares if you "saved space". ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 - Ubiquitious abbreviations probably don't count against you. However, what is "ubiquitious" varies more than you think within a field.
   - Common methods (fMRI, EEG, fNIRS) are probably OK


## Emphasis

 - Using font changes to highlight important information can help reviewers (espeically the ones who are skimming!) zero in on important information. Caveats:
   1. If you emphasize too much, it loses meaning. Be choosey about what you emphasize.
   2. *Don't use too many types of emphasis.* It's <u>distracting</u>, and leaves the reader wondering **what the <u>*difference*</u> is** between different kinds of emphasis. (**I use bold for highlighting main points.**)

## Emphasis

üí° In olden times, underlining was used to tell the typesetter something should be put in italics.

Typewriters did not have an italic option, so underline was the only option.

From a historical perspective it makes no sense to have both <u>underlining</u> and _italics_, much less <u>_both_</u> üò±



## Emphasis
 Font changes are not the only way to highlight ideas or create emphasis. You can also use your structure and white space to emphasize things.
 
 "Structural emphasis" might include headings, topic sentences, or figure captions.

## References

 - Author, date
   - Pros: People who know the field see the reference
   - Cons: People who don't get no benefit, uses more space
- Numbered
  - Pros: Saves space
  - Cons: Reviewers often don't look these up

No matter which approach you take, be sensitive to how reviewers use (or don't) the information, and don't over-do the references, because it doesn't help.<sup>45, 46, 52-57, 74</sup>


## Figures
 - Often underrated
 - My hypothesis: Even readers who "don't care" about nice figures have an easier time understanding your proposal if it has good figures


## Figures

THERE IS NOTHING MORE ANNOYING THAN AN ILLEGIBLE FIGURE


## What makes "good" figures?

 - Understandable with a minimal legend
 - Have a legend and a figure number
 - Legible font (!)
 - Labeled axes (!)
 - Look nice when you zoom in


## What makes "good" figures?

 - These may all seem basic but are frequently ignored. Why? Because applicants underrate the importance of figures...
 - AND because the figure that worked for a journal article may not be optimized for your grant.

## Figure example

![](images/McLaughlin2018_2panel.png){fig-align="right"}

## Figure example
In text, this is either way too small, or huge (and still looks bad)

![](images/McLaughlin2018_2panel_text.png){fig-align="center"}

## Figure example
Still too small

![](images/McLaughlin2018_1panel_text.png){fig-align="center"}


## Re-drawing figures

The solution? **Re-draw the figure.**

 - Make sure font is legible (8+ points)
 - Axes labels legible and make sense
 - Color scheme and labels match text of grant

## Re-drawing figures

How to re-draw figures?

  1. Original figure as one layer in Illustrator (or similar), locked
  2. Trace new layer on top

(N.B. If you want good figures you need to learn at least the basics of a vector art program, like Illustrator)

  * _Raster graphics_ have specific information for each pixel. If you zoom in, it requires more pixels, and things look fuzzy. Common types include JPG, PNG, and GIF.
  * _Vector graphics_ describe the image in terms of shapes (EPS, PDF) and scale to arbitrary sizes.


## Re-drawing figures
Better

## Advanced figures

 - Have a consistent color scheme throughout your grant
 - Make sure to have high-resolution (or ideally, vector) graphics so they look good when zoomed in


## Grant example



## Summary

 - Start early and iterate
 - Be inspired by other people's grants

## Questions? {background-image="images/jp01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat"}



## Homework

 - Finish a research strategy


## Next time {background-image="images/huskies01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat" background-opacity=0.5}

- Getting feedback on a drafted grant?
- Considerations for fellowships (e.g. training plan)?
- Responding to comments / preparing a resubmission?
