##

 - The goal of this grant group is to help you to submit an NIH grant in 9 months or so, and feel comfortable doing so.
 - The first day is a general overview; most topics will be covered in more detail in the future.


## What questions do you have about grants? {background-image="images/isec01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat" background-opacity=0.5}



## Caveats

 - Everyone has opinions on grants
 - Probably, no one is 100% correct
    - If someone is, it is definitely not me
 - Take everything with a grain of salt (TEWAGOS)...including anything I say
  
  
::: aside
A lot of what I say will be either a partial truth, a convenient interpretation, or flat-out wrong. My goal is to get you started and thinking so you can find your own way.
:::

## Institutes and Centers (IC)

 - NIH is the National Institute**s** (plural) of Health
 - NIH is made up of 27 institutes and centers
   - Each has a research agenda and funding priorities
 - The IC is what funds your work
 - Knowing IC priorities can help (with caveats)

:::

## Choosing an IC for your work

 - Look at who has funded similar work in your field
 - Read IC statements about funding priorities
 - Keep an eye out for funding announcements from ICs
  - You can _request_ to be assigned to an institute, but NIH (specifically the Center for Scientific Review) makes the decision.

## NIH RePORTER

 - NIH RePORTER ([reporter.nih.gov][reporter]) is a Searchable database of funded NIH grants
 - e.g. you could search for a well-respected scientist doing similar work to you, and see what IC(s) fund them

## Funding mechanisms

 - Research grants (R series)
 - Career development awards (K series)
 - Research and training fellowships (T and F series)
 - Program project/center grants (P series)
 - Resource grants
 - Sometimes, other mechanisms...

:::


## Common funding mechanisms

 - R01
    - Most common grant program, used by all ICs
    - Usually 3-5 years
    - Budgets can vary, typically up to $500k/year direct costs
  
::: aside
  NIH grant mechanisms are a letter followed by two numbers. We say "R oh one" for R01 but it is written R-zero-one.
:::


## Common funding mechanisms

 - R03
    - Small grant program (3 years, $50k/year)
 - R21
    - "Exploratory" research (2-3 years, $275k total)
    

## Program Announcement (PA) / Notice of funding opportunity (NOFO)

 - Must specify what funding opportunity your application is in response to.
 - Make sure you are looking at the most recent one.
 - For many R01s this is a "Parent R01"
    - <https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-185.html>
 - You can search NIH for funding announcements
      - <https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/subscribe.htm>

  - [NOFOs used to be called Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs).](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2023/03/02/foa-or-nofo-its-all-about-funding/)

## Deadlines

 - Be aware of the [due dates][1]
 - Typically three cycles per year
 - E.g., for R01s: February 5, June 5, October 5
 - _Note:_ Internal deadlines may be earlier! Make sure to check *early* in the process.

## How grants are reviewed

 - Grants are submitted by the institution
 - The [Center for Scientific Review (CSR)][csr] assigns what they deem an appropriate IC and study section (though sometimes an IC will convene their own panel for a specific FOA)
 - Study section rates the science but "does not make funding decisions"
 - Scores are passed to the IC, which decides on funding
 - (In practice, reviewers are likely to realize their scores contribute to funding decisions!)

[csr]: https://public.csr.nih.gov

## Study section

 - Group of people who (hopefully) have the expertise to judge scientific content of a grant
 - Loosely centered on a small number of topics, individual expertise varies

## Grant scoring

![](images/csr-scoring.png) 

## How a grant is typically reviewed

 -  3 reviewers assigned to each grant, and give a preliminary score (1-9, where 1 is the best). These three scores are averaged, and grants sorted.
 - The lowest (worst) ~50% of grants are not discussed (N.D.)
    - Applicants receive comments and scores from 3 reviewers
 - The top (best) ~50% of grants are discussed in person

## How a grant is typically reviewed

 - During discussion, the primary reviewer provides an overview of the grant for all reviewers, and highlights "score-driving" strengths and weaknesses. Reviewers 2 and 3 follow, ideally highlighting differences.
 - Any member of the panel can ask questions. Sometimes discussions are short, sometimes long.
 - Original 3 reviewers give their final scores.
 - *Every member of the panel provides a score.*
 - The chair writes a summary of the discussion.


## Questions? {background-image="images/jp01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat"}



## Homework

 - Make sure your [eRA Commons][commons] account is accurate
 - Choose a mechanism
 - Choose a topic
 - Choose IC
 - Choose 2 potential study sections (you can change these)
 - Think about budget and investigators
 - Figure out who your grant administrator is

 [commons]: https://public.era.nih.gov/commonsplus/



## Homework notes

 - These starting steps might seem straightforward but they can be tricky
 - For example, the topic may push you towards one institute or potential study section; different approaches may require different budgets, etc.
 - Remember, you can change your mind!


## Next time {background-image="images/huskies01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat" background-opacity=0.5}

 - Now that you have a potential topic, how to get started?
    - Budget
    - Specific aims
