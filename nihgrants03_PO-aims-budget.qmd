## Homework updates and questions {background-image="images/isec01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat" background-opacity=0.5}



## Getting started

The foundation of your grant is the aims and budget. And  program officer can guide you. These three topics are where we start.

![](images/aims-budget-PO.svg) 



## Five rules for specific aims

 1. You will have 3 specific aims. The number of the aims will be three. You will not have two aims, nor four aims.

 2. Tell the reviewers what the goal of the project is. (E.g. a sentence, in bold, that begins: "**The goal of this project is...**")

 3. Pretend your reader is not an expert in your field, is tired, overworked, and under a strict deadline. Now get them excited in the first paragraph.

 4. Don't use jargon. You are allowed one _mayyyyybe_ two acronyms for your entire grant; don't squander them.

 5. Avoid references in your aims. 




## Budget

 - Mechanism determines maximum budget
 - There may be different requirements depending on amount (e.g., modular vs. detailed for an R01)
 - Usually limits are listed on *direct costs* (the money you use for research), not including *indirect costs* (what the university gets to pay for space, electricity, etc.)

 ::: aside
 Indirect costs are negotiated between every institution and the NIH. The current Northeastern rate is 59.5%. That means if you have $100k in direct costs, NIH pays Northeastern $159,500 ($59,500 of which goes to somoone other than you).
