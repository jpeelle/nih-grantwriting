## Homework updates and questions {background-image="images/isec01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat" background-opacity=0.5}



## Getting started

The foundation of your grant is the aims and budget. And  program officer can guide you. These three topics are where we start.

![](images/aims-budget-PO.svg) 


## Specific aims

- Just like a good abstract, convey:
  - What is the state of knowledge
  - What is the gap/problem?
  - How does this proposal help?
  - **Why should we care?**
- Remember your audience!


## Five rules for specific aims

 1. You will have 3 specific aims. The number of the aims will be three. You will not have two aims, nor four aims.

 2. Tell the reviewers what the goal is. (E.g. a sentence, in bold, that begins: "**The goal of this project is...**")

 3. Pretend your reader is not an expert in your field, is tired, overworked, and under a strict deadline. Now get them excited in the first paragraph.

 4. Don't use jargon. You are allowed one _mayyyyybe_ two acronyms for your entire grant; don't squander them.

 5. Avoid references in your aims. 




## Budget

 - Mechanism determines maximum budget
 - There may be different requirements depending on amount (e.g., modular vs. detailed for an R01)
 - Usually limits are listed on *direct costs* (the money you use for research), not including *indirect costs* (what the university gets to pay for space, electricity, etc.)

::: aside
Indirect costs are negotiated between every institution and the NIH. The current Northeastern rate is 59.5%. That means if you have $100k in direct costs, NIH pays Northeastern $159,500 ($59,500 of which goes to somoone other than you).

## Budget: getting started

- Personnel tend to be the biggest item; start here
  - If a TBN, a starting salary or someone with an equivalent position
  - Fringe/benefits need consideration
  - Yearly increases? Make sure to follow institutional/NIH policy
- Send your grant admin a list of personnel and effort and see where you are at
  - If feeling brave, add a few other categories you know you will  need - particularly any large items (e.g., equipment)

## Personnel: PI

- Protect your (PI) time and salary
- Effort should broadly seem reasonable for what you propose
- If you have no other grants, it makes sense to have significant effort on an R01
  - Conversely, if you have 6 grants, it will not seem believable or sensible for you to have a lot of effort on a new grant (unless a bunch are ending)
- If you get an award, can adjust effort of key personnel up to 25% without writing a justification
  - 4 months of effort gives you flexibility from 3-5 months

## Personnel: Key personnel

Key personnel are not only important ("key") to the project, but have other requirements:

  1. Can't adjust effort more than 25% without justification/approval
  2. Provide a biosketch

  Most co-investigators will be key personnel.

## Personnel: Key personnel

 - It is unusual to see grant with PI as only key personnel
 - As a junior person, having a senior person as a co-investigator and key personnel can be useful
    - Reviewers will use their effort, in part, to gauge that person's commitment to the project
      - Senior people tend to be expensive
      - 1 month is fine, 0.5 months also common
  - One reason to get the budget roughly sorted early is that effort discussions with co-investigators should happen transparently and early on

## Personnel: TBNs

If you don't already know a specific person, assume:

 - They will take longer to hire than you expect
 - They will be less productive than you expect

These problems are exacerbated if you have under-budgeted.


## Misc. budget thoughts

 - Many (but not all) institutes have a flat budget cut (e.g., 15%) for all awards. Plan accordingly.
 - There are no prizes for being frugal, but reviewers get grumpy if your budget seems padded.


## Program officers

- Each institute has program officers (POs) who help implement the priorities of the institute
  - Often former researchers
  - Have specific topics they cover
- How do you identify "your" PO?
   - After submission: assigned (out of your control)
   - Before submission: guess, [Matchmaker][match], ask

[match]: https://reporter.nih.gov/matchmaker

## What your PO can help with

- Reading your aims and giving you advice about fit of your research for IC and mechanism
- Give advice on study section selction
- Help interpret study section comments (sometimes)
  - PO is not involved in review but may be in the room
  - If they were not in the room, they can guess at some stuff but in my experience are no more helpful than an experienced colleague
  - If they *were* in the room, they may remember things not captured in the comments
- Discretion for funding in certain situations (e.g., NOSI, ECR)

## What your PO *cannot* help with

- Handling specific reviewer comments (they can offer advice but have no special knowledge or power)


## When to contact your PO

- Stock advice: Contact them early in the process, once you have aims (they will almost certainly request aims)
   - Especially important if unsure of mechanism, eligibility etc.
- Once your questions are answered, contact after you get study section comments back, if you think they can be helpful.
  - I have had a PO skim comments with me, which was not helpful
  - I have also had a PO help me get an R56 when my R01 A1 was 20th percentile (even though she never responded to my initial email)


## Questions? {background-image="images/jp01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat"}



## Homework

 - Draft a budget justification
 - Draft specific aims
 - Identify your likely program officer


## Next time {background-image="images/huskies01.jpg" background-repeat="no-repeat" background-opacity=0.5}

 - Know your audience: more on study section
 - Review criteria
 - Formatting considerations

 OR non research stuff
